## Understanding The Platform

The Platform is comprised of __Three Pillars__ that work together to allow Teams to deliver applications.

1. __The People__:
  - Platform Teams that Deliver their Business Applications through Openshift
  - Platform Service and Developer Experience Teams that are continuously working to improve the platforms capabilities and support Platform Teams
  - Partners that support the infrastructure of the platform as well as performing the OCP 4.2 upgrade

2. __The Technology__:
  - This is primarily about Openshift. A platform that allows teams to cloud-ready/cloud-native applications effectively and with speed. This platform is best suited to Agile teams.

3. __The Process__:
  - Government process, although needed, can be a hinderance to modern app development.
  - Product Teams, as well as Platform Services and Partners are working to shape processes that work better for teams, developers to deliver __top notch__ applications to the Citizens of BC.

## More Than Just Openshift

As you can see there is a lot going on in order to support a __Hybrid Cloud Containerized Platform__ like Openshift. Working on this platform requires the __DevOps__ mindset. The idea that products should be continuously improved. The idea that people need to be brought together to solve common problems. The idea that the status-quo is not good enough and that there should be a drive to be innovative and creative.


## BC Gov Openshift Platform Myths

1. It is a Hosting Platform

No! It is not just a hosting platform. In other words, Openshift is not a place for a team to dump their application. It will not be maintained for the team by Platform Service members. Applications like plants, pets, and humans need care and feeding. The deployable unit of an application is ___not the application itself__ it is the ___the Team__. The team has the knowledge, the background, and the expertise to support the application for its lifetime. The expectation is that there will be __at least one__, if not two, members dedicated to supporting their applications for their lifetime.

2. It is Free and therefor the obvious choice for my ministry

Openshift and its support is maintained through the __OCIO's__ budget. There is not an __additional cost__
placed forward to teams or their ministry at this time. That being said, the main driver for joining this platform should be along: "I have a business need and want to enable a team to deliver this need as quickly and as effectively as possible. In addition, the team will learn and or improve their skills with
modern cloud-based app development and operation."
