## How To Navigate Through This Journey

This journey's main focus is on the 'Developer' or 'Product Team' persona. Therefor, the main line
of this journey will focus on __Delivering and Maintaining an Application__. There will be several
side-stations along the line for helpful resources.


## Persona Specific Roles

Some stops along this journey require a specific action to be done. These will be identified by a persona.

For example, there will be discussion on an __'Alignment Meeting'__ shortly which will require whoever
is the __Product Owner__ to attend.
