# Communication, Community and Support

- Product Teams should aim for self-sufficiency WRT management of pipelines, definition of OCP assets, deployments, scaling, monitoring, etc.
    - Training, tutorials, books, are available to help with the learning curve
    - [Openshift training](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/openshift-101-tickets-85533754763)
    - [Openshift 4 Migration](hhttps://github.com/BCDevOps/OpenShift4-Migration/issues)
- Community (Internet, and Gov) are the support mechanisms - not individual resources
- Primary communication mechanism is a mailing list list that you may join at [subscribe.developer.gov.bc.ca](https://subscribe.developer.gov.bc.ca)
- You can also monitor [Rocket.chat](chat.developer.gov.bc.ca) for up to date news on platform changes, ask questions, and get help
    - Teams should monitor (for alerts/notifications, etc.) and participate (answer questions, share findings, etc.)
    - Follow [community conventions/etiquette](https://github.com/bcgov/devhub-resources/blob/master/resources/community/chat_conventions.md) WRT use of specific channels, appropriate @ mentions, DMs, etc.
- Technical team members should join and participate in DevOps Commons community - meetups, etc.
- Product Owner/Managers should join Product Manager commons
> Devops Commons have been suspended as they were an in person meeting. Please stay tuned for the next available meetup.  
- Teams should share timelines of major milestones (e.g. first release, expected increased volume) ahead of time with PM Commons and platform team
