    - Training, tutorials, books are available to help with the learning curve (search in [DevHub](http://developer.gov.bc.ca) and in Internet)

- Primary communication mechanism is a mailing list that you may sign up for the Platform Subscription Service at  [subscribe.developer.gov.bc.ca](https://subscribe.developer.gov.bc.ca)
- You can also monitor [Rocket.chat](chat.developer.gov.bc.ca) for up to date news on platform changes, ask questions, and get help
    - **Teams should monitor [#devops-alerts](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-alerts) channel in Rocket.chat at all times** (for critical alerts, outage notifications, etc.) and participate (answer questions, share findings, etc.) in [#devops-operations](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-operations) and [#devops-how-to](https://chat.developer.gov.bc.ca/channel/devops-how-to). Follow [community conventions/etiquette](https://github.com/bcgov/devhub-resources/blob/master/resources/community/chat_conventions.md) WRT use of specific channels, appropriate @ mentions, DMs, etc.
- Important Platform announcements about major maintenance activities that may impact product team are also send out as **Technical Information Bulletins (TIBs)** through the government's change management process.
