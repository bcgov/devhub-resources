# My First Openshift Project

You've had an alignment meeting and the Team has been procured. The next task is to have a set of
Openshift Projects (AKA Namespaces) provisioned. How does one get that started? How can one leveage
shared components principles when building out their applications. 

This guide aims to provide examples/and demonstrations of how to get an Openshift project provisioned
as well as how to set up a simple __Hello World__ application in Openshift with __Jenkins__ as a
continuous deployment tool.
